    <p>The Modern Javascript Bootcamp (2020) focuses on cutting through unnecessary information and giving you just the facts, plain and simple.  You won't work with outdated frameworks, learn old styles of 
        programming, or build boring apps.  
        Instead, you'll only spend time writing practical code that can be used today and in the future on your own projects.  You'll learn - from very early on in the course - how to write beautiful 
        and reusable code that you'll be proud to show to a future employer.</p>
